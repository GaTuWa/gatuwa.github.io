On this page, I will showcase some of the research research projects that I have worked on, as well as ongoing project. I am both interested in collaboration and consulting on these matters so feel free to reach out if any of this is of your interest.



## Model-Based Clustering in Latent Factor Analysis

Ensuring fairness and interpretability in tools like surveys, questionnaires, and educational tests is essential. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis is a technique used to explore whether different groups respond differently to specific items, even when they have the same overall ability or trait level. Traditional DIF methods require prior knowledge of comparison groups and unbiased items, but this information is not always available. To address this, me and my collaborators have developed a flexible statistical framework that can identify hidden group differences and adjust for biased items without needing predefined groups or unbiased items. This method can be applied across various domains, from evaluating student assessments to understanding consumer preferences in market research. Our approach uses a regularized estimator and an efficient algorithm to uncover these hidden patterns, making it possible to ensure fairer assessments and more accurate insights.

In the figure below, we illustrate how this method can be used to adjust the estimated difficulty levels of questions in a university placement test for two distinct latent clusters that has been identified by our procedure: one that exhibits rapid response behavior due to time pressure, and another baseline group with stable response patterns.

The proposed framework is currently being extended in a number of directions, including statistical inference for the DIF effect (the dashed line in the figure above). Please let me know if you are working with survey-type data, possibly with large numbers of measurement units (respondents/costumers/students etc) and variables, and are interested in multi-group analysis.
