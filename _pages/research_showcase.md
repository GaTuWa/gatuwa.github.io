## Model-Based Clustering in Latent Factor Analysis
Latent factor analysis provides a model-based approach to dimension reduction, where observed variables are assumed to be generated by a set of latent factors that are typically much fewer in number. While these latent factors are usually considered continuous, a multi-group analysis is often needed to better capture the underlying data structure. In many cases, either no additional covariates are collected, or there are too many to easily determine which groups to compare. To address this, my collaborators and I have developed new statistical methods that identify latent clusters within the data and specify a latent factor model for each cluster. Additionally, we can quantify the differences between groups through group-specific intercepts and slope parameters. In the figure below, we illustrate how estimates of the easiness level of each question in a university placement test are adjusted for two identified latent clusters: one cluster that reacts to the time-limit of the test by engaging in rapid response behavior towards the end of the test, and one baseline cluster which does not change behavior.
