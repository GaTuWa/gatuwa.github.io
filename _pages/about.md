I’m a Research Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I belong to the [Psychometrics Lab](https://psychometricslab.com/). Previously, I was conducting postdoctoral research at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from Umeå University in Sweden, where I worked on statistical methodology related to fairness in large-scale educational testing under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

My field of research is currently centered around statistical modeling, estimation and computation for the social and behavioral sciences. Topics include item response theory, model-based clustering, multivariate outlier detection and exploratory factor analysis. My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council.
