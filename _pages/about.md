I’m a Lecturer (Assistant Professor - tenure-track) at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/) at Lancaster University. Previously, I've held post-doc positions at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.umu.se/en/usbe/about-us/statistics/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

My research is centered around **fairness** and **interpretability** of statistical models and machine learning algorithms for the **social** and **behavioral sciences**. So far, I have addressed these topics by developing new methodology for e.g. **model-based clustering**, **multivariate outlier detection** and **exploratory factor analysis**.
