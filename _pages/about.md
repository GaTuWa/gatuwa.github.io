I’m an Assistant Professor (*Lecturer* in the UK system) in Statistics in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/) at [Lancaster university](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I was advised by Dr [Yunxiao Chen](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/yunxiao-chen) and Professor [Irini Moustaki](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/irini-moustaki). Prior to that, I was a postdoc at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.umu.se/en/usbe/about-us/statistics/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

## My research

My research focuses on developing flexible statistical and machine learning methods to accurately identify latent (unobserved) structures in social, behavioural and health data. Much of my research is motivated by concepts of fairness and interpretability and is often informed by collaborations with domain experts from various fields, including economics, psychology, and education. 

Among my current projects, I am collaborating with researchers at Lancaster Medical School to study physical, mental, and social inequalities among school children in Northern England. I also work with the Psychology Department at Lancaster to study early literacy acquisition in game-based environments. In addition, I regularly collaborate with people in the educational testing industry.

From a statistical point of view, my research so far has focused on developing theory, methodology and computational methods for:   
* The structural learning of latent variable models,
* multivariate outlier detection,
* model-based clustering and classification,
* change-point detection for latent factor models.

Please see the Research showcase page for some examples of my research.
