I’m a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Statistics at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/) at [Lancaster university](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I was advised by Dr [Yunxiao Chen](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/yunxiao-chen) and Professor [Irini Moustaki](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/irini-moustaki). Before that, I was a postdoc at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.umu.se/en/usbe/about-us/statistics/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

My research interests lie in the intersection between latent variable modeling and statistical learning. Much of my research is motivated by concepts of fairness and interpretability in the social and behavioral sciences. Topics include: 
* The structural learning of latent variable models,
* multivariate outlier detection,
* model-based clustering,
* algorithmic fairness in educational measurement,
* change-point detection for latent factor models.

If you are a student interested in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:g.wallin@lancaster.ac.uk).
