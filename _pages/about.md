I’m a postdoctoral researcher in statistics and a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). Previously, I was conducting postdoctoral research at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) in Sophia Antipolis, France. I received my PhD in 2020 from Umeå University in Sweden, where I worked on psychometric modeling for large-scale assessments under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/personal/marie-wiberg/).

My field of research is currently centered around statistical modeling, estimation and computation for the social and behavioral sciences. Topics include item response data analysis, model-based clustering, multivariate outlier detection and test score equating. My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council.
