I’m a Research Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I belong to the [Social Statistics Research Group](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/research/Social-Statistics). Previously, I was conducting postdoctoral research at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.umu.se/en/usbe/about-us/statistics/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, where I worked on statistical methodology related to fairness in large-scale educational testing under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

My field of research is centered around fairness and interpretability of statistical models and machine learning algorithms for the social and behavioral sciences. So far, I have approached these topics using model-based clustering, multivariate outlier detection, techniques from causal inference, item response theory and exploratory factor analysis. Check out [webpage](https://psychometricslab.com/) of the research group I belong to for more information about these topics. My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council.
