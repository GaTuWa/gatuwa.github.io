I’m a postdoctoral researcher in statistics and currently a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at London School of Economics and Political Science, following a three year research grant from the Swedish Research Council. Previously, I was conducting postdoctoral research at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) in Sophia Antipolis, France. I was part of the [Maasai](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/) (Models and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence) team, and also affiliated with the [J.A. Dieudonné lab](https://math.unice.fr/laboratoire/pr%C3%A9sentation-du-laboratoire.html), which is the mathematics department of Université Côte d’Azur.

My field of research is currently centered around statistical modeling, estimation and computation for the social and behavioral sciences. Topics include item response data analysis, model-based clustering, multivariate outlier detection and test score equating. 

I received my PhD in 2020 from Umeå University in Sweden, where I worked on psychometric modeling for large-scale assessments under the supervision of Professor Marie Wiberg.
