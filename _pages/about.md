I’m a Research Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) where I belong to the [Social Statistics Research Group](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/research/Social-Statistics). Previously, I was conducting postdoctoral research at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en). I received my PhD in 2020 from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.umu.se/en/usbe/about-us/statistics/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, under the supervision of Professor [Marie Wiberg](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/marie-wiberg/).

My research is centered around fairness and interpretability of statistical models and machine learning algorithms for the social and behavioral sciences. So far, I have addressed these topics by developing new methodology for e.g. model-based clustering, multivariate outlier detection and exploratory factor analysis.  

Check out the [web page](https://psychometricslab.com/) of my research group for more information related to my research. 

My research is funded by the Swedish Research Council.
